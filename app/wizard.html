<p>"The Quadlings think she is good," said the soldier, "and she is kind to everyone.  I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows how to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived."</p>
<p>"How can I get to her castle?" asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>"The road is straight to the South," he answered, "but it is said to be full of dangers to travelers.  There are wild beasts in the woods, and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City."</p>
<p>The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:</p>
<p>"It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is to travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her.  For, of course, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas."</p>
<p>"You must have been thinking again," remarked the Tin Woodman.</p>
<p>"I have," said the Scarecrow.</p>
